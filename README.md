# spring-boot-solo-two

A small Spring Boot App to show skills

Milestones:

1) Have a command line runner that outputs hello world
2) Have one entity class and a command line runner that inserts one row into an h2 database. Then you can examine that row using the h2-console in a web browser
3) Have a HTML form that does a HTTP POST to a controller that inserts a row into the database (confirm with h2-console)
4) Have a HTTP GET controller endpoint that outputs to the web browser each row in a table
